# GitHub Security Baseline

This project is prepared to become a public repository.

Required repository settings after the remote is created:

1. Enable Secret Protection / Secret Scanning.
2. Enable Push Protection.
3. Enable Code Scanning with CodeQL Default Setup.
4. Enable Code Quality.
5. Enable Dependabot alerts.
6. Enable Dependabot security updates.
7. Enable Dependabot version updates from `.github/dependabot.yml`.
8. Enable Dependabot auto-merge workflow only after branch rules are active.
9. Protect `main` with a repository ruleset.
10. Require code scanning results with CodeQL security alerts: All / alerts: All.
11. Require code quality thresholds: Any / Any.
12. Require CI to pass before merge.
13. Disable force-push and branch deletion on `main`.

Package publishing is active after the repository is created and the `NPM_TOKEN` secret is
configured. Pushes to `main` auto-create an organization-standard display tag such as `v02.00.00`
from `package.json`; the tag then creates a normal GitHub Release and publishes
`@lcv-ideas-software/cross-review-mcp-sdk` to npmjs.com and GitHub Packages. The SDK package is
separate from the CLI package `@lcv-ideas-software/cross-review-mcp`.
Prerelease versions publish with their prerelease label as the npm dist-tag, so alpha builds do not
replace either stable `latest` channel.

CodeQL Advanced Setup is intentionally not committed. If Advanced Setup ever becomes necessary,
it must be proposed with justification and approved before adding a workflow file.

No secrets, runtime sessions, logs, prompts, provider responses, API keys or local AI memories may
be committed. The `.gitignore` is intentionally strict because this repository is designed for
public release from its first push.
